# Tend-Analysis-Using-Text-Mining-and-Fuzzy-C-Means-CLustering
Text Mining is used to convert text data into numeric data so that it can be processed further. Clustering is classified as soft clustering (fuzzy) and hard clustering. Hard clustering will divide data into clusters strictly without any overlapping membership with other clusters. Soft clustering can enter data into several clusters with a certain degree of membership value. Different membership values make fuzzy grouping have more natural results than hard clustering because objects at the boundary between several classes are not forced to fully fit into one class but each object is assigned a degree of membership. Fuzzy c-means has an advantage in terms of having a more precise placement of the cluster center compared to other cluster methods, by improving the cluster center repeatedly. The formation of the best number of clusters is seen based on the maximum silhouette coefficient. Wordcloud is used to determine the dominant topic in each cluster. Word cloud is a form of text data visualization
